## Here is why

Just last month (November 2019) an
[australian journalist](https://twitter.com/TaliaShadwell/status/1191054331119837185)
suddenly got bombarded with ads targeting pregnant women.
Why? She forgot to log her cycle, her app concluded she had
to be pregnant and her app let third parties in on the
«secret».

This type of experience is backed up by:

- [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636)]
  Unbeknown to most people, in many cases that data is being
  shared with someone else: Facebook Inc.
- [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/period-tracker-apps-facebook-maya-mia-fem):
  It also shared “reminders” within the app to take birth
  control medication with Facebook.
- [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/sep/14/your-period-tracking-app-could-be-sharing-intimate-details-with-all-of-facebook):
  These apps then shared user information with the company
  so it could keep track of _how many of its employees_ were
  trying to get pregnant.

For me, [@raae](https://raae.codes), the journey started
when the level of detail I found in existing apps made me
less inclined to use them; it felt creepy, a little
invasive.

I wanted to make my own, but if I was going to do so I did
not wanted to make it impossible to spy on my users.

## Another world is possible

It turs out encryption is key! But it also turns out there
is little information out there for us privacy newbies (both
devs and consumers alike).

I would like to change that and have talked about encryption
in front of developers in Oslo, Budapest and Bochum this
fall.

In addition to being a less intrusive and more private
mentrual cycle tracker, POW! will be at the center of an
ongoing effort to:

- Educate developers on how to make apps that "can't be
  evil" and why this is important.
- Educate consumers so they can make informed choices about
  privacy.

![@raae delivering a talk](/talk.jpg "Talk") _Talk on
encryption for newbies_

The plan is to create courses, webinars and keep speaking at
conferences with POW! as the real world example.

## What can you do?

The first order of business is to get POW! ready for an
official launch March 8th 2020, and with your help I can:

- Find and pay a statistician to help me with the prediction
  engine.
- Take time to code during the day (in addition to nights
  and weekend).
- Buy food and drinks for the launch party.

## What do you get in return?

You will get lifetime access to POW! no matter what happens
to the business model in the future.

In addition there is the option to prepay for a webinar on
privacy in apps (dev and non-dev edition) to be held in
April.

Or if you would like to put on an event (at home, at work,
...) book a full length talk on lessons learned building
POW! catered to your audience.
