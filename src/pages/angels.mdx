## Why is this stuff important?

Just last month (November 2019) an
[australian journalist](https://twitter.com/TaliaShadwell/status/1191054331119837185)
suddenly got bombarded with ads targeting pregnant women.
Why? She forgot to log her cycle, her app concluded she had
to be pregnant and her app let third parties in on the
«secret».

This type of experience is backed up by:

- [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636)]
  Unbeknown to most people, in many cases that data is being
  shared with someone else: Facebook Inc.
- [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/period-tracker-apps-facebook-maya-mia-fem):
  It also shared “reminders” within the app to take birth
  control medication with Facebook.
- [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/sep/14/your-period-tracking-app-could-be-sharing-intimate-details-with-all-of-facebook):
  These apps then shared user information with the company
  so it could keep track of _how many of its employees_ were
  trying to get pregnant.

I focus on menstrual trackers, because that's where it got
personal for me.

The level of detail I found in existing apps made me less
inclined to use them; it felt creepy, a little invasive.

So at the beginning of this year I asked myself: "A privacy
first period tracker? Is it even possible?"

## Another world is possible

Yes it is. It turs out encryption is key! But it also turns
out there is little accesible information out there for us
who are not security experts.

I would like to change that. This fall I talked about
encryption in front of developers in Oslo, Budapest and
Bochum.

First and foremost my goal is to create a straight forward
menstrual cycle tracker that #CantBeEvil.

But secondly POW! will be the center for ongoing effort to
educate developers on how to make apps that "can't be evil"
and why this is important.

encryption for newbies_

The plan is to create courses, webinars and keep speaking at
conferences with POW! as the real world example.
